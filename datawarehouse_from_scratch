# What is data warehouse?

"A subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant, and non-volatile collection of data in support of managements decision-making process."

**Subject-oriented?**
Focus on a business area (sales, customers, finance, etc.)

**Integrated?**
The data we use includes multiple sources and systems.

**Time-variant?**
You can keep historical data inside the data warehouse.

**Non-volatile?**
Once the data enters the data-warehouse it is not deleted or modified.
