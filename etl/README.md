# What is ETL in a nutshell?

It stants for: **Extract** / **Load** / **Transform**

**/ Extract /**
There is a source system and what we want to do is to get our data from the source and move it to the target, source and target can be database tables. The first step is to specify which data we have to load from the source, then we have to prepare it and load it later to the target so this step in the ETL process we call it **"Extract"**.

**/ Transform /**
THen we take the extracted data and we will do some manipulations, transformations and change the shape of that data, this is the most heavy working or difficult part of the process, we can do several stuff like **data cleansing**, **data integration**, **formatting**, **data normalization**.

**/ Load /**
In this final stage of the process we are going to take the new transaformed and prepared data and insert it into the final destination or target.
