# Transform 

Then we take the extracted data and we will do some manipulations, transformations and change the shape of that data, this is the most heavy working or difficult part of the process, we can do several stuff like **data cleansing**, **data integration**, **formatting**, **data normalization**.

**/Transfornation Types/**
**Data Enrichment** - Add values to our datasets.
**Data Integration** - Have multiple sources and we bring everything to one data model.
**Derived Columns** - Derived new columns based on already existing one.
 **Data Aggregations** - Here the data is aggregated to a different glanularity.
**Data Normalization & Standarization** - The sources have values that are like a code and we map it to more friendly values for analyzers so it can be more easy to understand and use.
**Remove Duplicates** - 
**Business Rules & Logics** - Depending on the business we can define different criteria in order to build new columns.

**/Data Cleansing/** - There are many different ways in how to clear our data:
**Remove Duplicates** 
**Data Filtering**  
**Handling Missing Data**
**Handling Invalid Values** 
**Handling Unwanted Spaces** 
**Data Type Casting** 
**Outlier Detection**
