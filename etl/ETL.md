# What is ETL?

It stants for: **Extract** / **Load** / **Transform**

There is a source system and what we want to do is to get our data from the source and move it to the target, source and target can be database tables. The first step is to specify which data we have to load from the source, then we have to prepare it and load it later to the target so this step in the ETL process we call it **extract**
